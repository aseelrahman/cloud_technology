            Bangladesh (Bengali: বাংলাদেশ), officially the People's Republic of
            Bangladesh, is a country in South Asia. It is the eighth-most
            populous country in the world and is among the most densely
            populated countries with a population of nearly 170 million in an
            area of 148,460 square kilometres (57,320 sq mi). Bangladesh shares
            land borders with India to the north, west, and east, and Myanmar to
            the southeast. To the south, it has a coastline along the Bay of
            Bengal. It is narrowly separated from Bhutan and Nepal by the
            Siliguri Corridor, and from China by the mountainous Indian state of
            Sikkim in the north. Dhaka, the capital and largest city, is the
            nation's political, financial, and cultural centre. Chittagong, the
            second-largest city, is the busiest port on the Bay of Bengal.
            Khulna, Rajshahi and Sylhet are other major cities. The official
            language of Bangladesh is Bengali.
